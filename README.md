Amateur Coder Repository

I am a PhD Candidate in the Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program at The Ohio State University. My thesis lab recently performed single cell RNA Sequencing through 10X Genomics and now I need some help with the analysis through Seurat!!

I took an "R coding" class over a year ago which is the extent of my coding abilities.
